# Build Engine Randomizer
Build Engine Randomizer (Duke Nukem 3D, Ion Fury, Shadow Warrior, and maybe more in the future!)

Download build-engine-randomizer.exe from [the Releases page](https://github.com/Die4Ever/build-engine-randomizer/releases). Run it, point it to the game's GRP file, choose your settings, and click Randomize! Make sure you have a backup of your game files first.

For Duke Nukem 3D, I suggest using [EDuke32](https://dukeworld.com/eduke32/eduke32_current.zip) to run it. You can also get the [free Duke Nukem 3D demo here](https://dukeworld.duke4.net/2001-current/rtcm/duke3d-shareware/3dduke13SW.zip).

For Shadow Warrior, use `voidsw.exe` from that same download as EDuke32 (it's in the zip file). Shadow Warrior is freeware on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/238070/Shadow_Warrior_Classic_1997/) and [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/shadow_warrior_complete).

Randomizes enemies and items. For games that use CON files (Duke Nukem 3D and Ion Fury so far) it also randomizes values like maximum health and ammo values, and enemy strengths.
