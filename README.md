# Build Engine Randomizer
Build Engine Randomizer (Duke Nukem 3D, Ion Fury, Shadow Warrior, and more coming soon!)

Download build-engine-randomizer.exe from [the Releases page](https://github.com/Die4Ever/build-engine-randomizer/releases). Run it, point it to the game's GRP file, choose your settings, and click Randomize! Make sure you have a backup of your game files first.

For Duke Nukem 3D, I suggest using EDuke32 to run it https://dukeworld.com/eduke32/eduke32_current.zip

For Shadow Warrior, use `voidsw.exe` from that same download as EDuke32 (it's in the zip file).

"Damn, I'm lookin' good!"
