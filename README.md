# Build Engine Randomizer
Build Engine Randomizer (Duke Nukem 3D, Ion Fury, Shadow Warrior, and more coming soon!)

Download build-engine-randomizer.exe from [the Releases page](https://github.com/Die4Ever/build-engine-randomizer/releases). Run it, point it to the game's GRP file, choose your settings, and click Randomize! Make sure you have a backup of your game files first.

For Duke Nukem 3D, I suggest using [EDuke32](https://dukeworld.com/eduke32/eduke32_current.zip) to run it. You can also get the [free Duke Nukem 3D demo here](https://dukeworld.duke4.net/2001-current/rtcm/duke3d-shareware/3dduke13SW.zip).

For Shadow Warrior, use `voidsw.exe` from that same download as EDuke32 (it's in the zip file). Shadow Warrior is freeware on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/238070/Shadow_Warrior_Classic_1997/) and [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/shadow_warrior_complete).
