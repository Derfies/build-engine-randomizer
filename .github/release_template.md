Build Engine Randomizer (Duke Nukem 3D, Ion Fury, Shadow Warrior, Blood, PowerSlave/Exhumed and maybe more in the future!)

Download build-engine-randomizer.exe from the Assets section below. Run it, point it to the game's GRP file, choose your settings, and click Randomize! Make sure you have a backup of your game files first.

For Duke Nukem 3D, I suggest using [EDuke32](https://dukeworld.com/eduke32/eduke32_current.zip) to run it. EDuke32 has an option for "Custom game content directory", in this dropdown select "Randomizer". You can also get the [free Duke Nukem 3D demo here](https://dukeworld.duke4.net/2001-current/rtcm/duke3d-shareware/3dduke13SW.zip).

For Ion Fury you can also use EDuke32, which allows you to enable the "Use Randomizer Folder" option inside the Randomizer window, and then in EDuke32 set "Custom game content directory" to "Randomizer".

For Shadow Warrior, use [`voidsw.exe` from that same download as EDuke32](https://dukeworld.com/eduke32/eduke32_current.zip) (it's in the zip file). Shadow Warrior is freeware on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/238070/Shadow_Warrior_Classic_1997/) and [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/shadow_warrior_complete).

For Blood, I suggest using [NBlood](https://lerppu.net/wannabethesis/nblood/20220613-13229/nblood_win64_20220613-13229.zip) to run it. NBlood has an option for "Custom game content directory", in this dropdown select "Randomizer".

For PowerSlave (aka Exhumed) I suggest [PCExhumed](https://lerppu.net/wannabethesis/pcexhumed/20220613-13229/pcexhumed_win64_20220613-13229.zip) to run it. PCExhumed has an option for "Custom game content directory", in this dropdown select "Randomizer". You can get [the shareware demo here](https://dukeworld.com/2001-current/rtcm/powerslave-shareware/pwrslavesw.zip). This will not work with the Night Dive Studios 2022 release titled "PowerSlave Exhumed", as that is not based on the Build Engine.

Randomizes enemies and items. For games that use CON files (Duke Nukem 3D and Ion Fury so far) it also randomizes values like maximum health and ammo values, and enemy strengths.
